## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. **Start Small, Build Incrementally**
Don't try to implement everything at once. Focus on one component at a time.

### 2. **Test Continuously**
Write tests as you code, not after. This catches bugs early.

### 3. **Use the Domain Layer**
Your business logic is already complete. Just wrap it with infrastructure.

### 4. **Follow the Roadmap**
The 17-week plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` is your guide. Stick to it.

### 5. **Ask for Help**
Check documentation first, then Stack Overflow, then create GitHub issues.

### 6. **Keep It Islamic**
This is a religious tool. Ensure calculations are accurate and verified by scholars.
